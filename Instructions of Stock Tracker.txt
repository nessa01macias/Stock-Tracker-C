Hello! Welcome to "Stock tracker".

Please read the instructions below to know how to use and understand the program.

1) If user will read a database from a file, option [3] has to be chosen after starting the program.
If option [3] data to a file is chosen after option [4] buy a share, then the share[s] that
was/were just bought will be overwritten by the database and the information will be lost.

2) When the information is saved with option [2], two files.txt will be created. "Database.txt" which 
is made for the user view, and "filetoread.txt" which is used by C to be able to read the information 
with option [3]. 

3) Even though it is not possible to sell an determinate amount of shares in a stock due to lack of time,
user can modify the share with option [6], edit how many are remaining, and add a new share which can be 
set to sold later on.

4) Option [8] is designed thinking about a large amount of stocks that need to be filtered somehow to 
benefit the user. The general size of the stock tracker is 200 stocks, but that can be edited at the 
beginning of the file.

5) To save time during testing, "Database.txt" & "Toread.txt" have some stocks are inside them. They 
can be overwritten just by initializing the database with option [1] and then saving the database with
option [2].

6) That's everything, thank you for using it!
